Functioning as symbolic representations of real money - TUTORIAL

"Spara Pengar" coins, translating to "Save Money" in Swedish, are innovative tokens designed to instill financial responsibility in children while making the process of saving and spending an engaging experience. Functioning as symbolic representations of real money, these tokens serve as an alternative to traditional cash or direct bank transfers when children receive funds for special occasions like birthdays or New Year celebrations.
