Functioning as symbolic representations of real money - TUTORIAL

**Spara Pengar** coins, translating to "Save Money" in Swedish, are innovative tokens designed to instill financial responsibility in children while making the process of saving and spending an engaging experience. Functioning as symbolic representations of real money, these tokens serve as an alternative to traditional cash or direct bank transfers when children receive funds for special occasions like birthdays or New Year celebrations.

### How does it work


1. Allocation: Parents assign "Spara Pengar" coins equivalent to received funds (e.g., 100€ = 100 coins) to the child's digital wallet.
2. Accumulation: Kids can save coins at their pace, receiving them weekly or during special occasions, building a sense of patience and goal-setting.
3. Transaction: When ready to make a purchase, children send back the corresponding coins (e.g., a 53€ toy requires sending 53 coins) to their parents.
